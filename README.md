# A Propensity Score Analysis on the Halo Effect of Exposing Academic Degrees in Online Communities

This repository contains a sample code for inferring the causal effects of exposing academic degrees in online communities. This study was presented at ICWSM-20 as a full paper [[paper]](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7321/7175).

 

## Summary of this study

This study aims to test the effects of transferring offline social status to online environments on community feedback; Applying the propensity score matching framework to the longitudinal dataset of two science-related subreddits, we found that exposing a high academic degree (e.g., Ph.D.) induces a positive perception, known as the halo effect.
